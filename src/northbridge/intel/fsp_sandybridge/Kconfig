	  This is the default PCI ID for the sandybridge/ivybridge graphics
	  devices.  This string names the vbios ROM in cbfs.  The following
	  PCI IDs will be remapped to load this ROM:
	  0x80860102, 0x8086010a, 0x80860112, 0x80860116
	  0x80860122, 0x80860126, 0x80860166

	help
	  On Sandybridge and Ivybridge systems the firmware image may
	  have to store a lot more than just coreboot, including:
	   - a firmware descriptor
	   - Intel Management Engine firmware
	  This option specifies the maximum size of the CBFS portion in the
	  firmware image.
